                    This is a bit of a personal diary while I'm learning some new languages and, since I'm pretty much
                    a C# programmer (albeit from a Delphi and Java background many years ago) I'm explaining things
                    to myself mostly by way of comparison to C#.
                </p>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h2><a href="./ruby.html"><img src="public/img/ruby-icon.png">Ruby</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        On the one hand, Ruby is very elegant. It's got great string handling, excellent support for lambdas
                        and other enumerable trickery and is generally very nice to read and write. Ruby also has an
                        exceptionally good package management system (Gems).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ruby does have one major shortcoming, in my opinion, which is the lack of real private methods
                        (Ruby's <code>private</code> methods are the equivalent of C# <code>protected</code> methods and
                        there are no explicit <code>override</code> or <code>new</code> keywords like you have in c#, so
                        it's far too easy to accidentially break/modify functionality from ancestor classes. The general
                        recommendation of Ruby fans/pros in this regard is don't extend classes that you don't know the
                        inner workings of intimately... which is a bit of a cop out I think (work around rather than
                        fix).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h2><a href="./python.html"><img src="public/img/python-icon.png"> Python</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Python is also a pleasure to work with. It's got cool stuff for creating generators, handling
                        sets and lists and there are generally fewer ways to do things in Python (one recommended way
                        where Ruby has umpteen different possibilities)... which makes it simpler to learn and probably
                        easier for teams top collaborate on code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python also appears to be generally more popular than Ruby, which makes for a large
                        user base when you need to reach out and ask for help. Finally, Python is quickly becoming the
                        de facto standard in data analytics applications (especially where engineering and scientific
                        computing are concerned)... all of which makes Python an excellent choice for the back-end.
