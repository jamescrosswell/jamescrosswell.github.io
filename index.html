                <p>
                    This is a bit of a personal diary while I'm learning some new scripting languages. Currently I'm
                    learning two languages and I keep changing my mind about which one I really want to sink my teeth
                    into:
                </p>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h2><a href="./ruby.html"><img src="public/img/ruby-icon.png">Ruby</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        On the one hand, Ruby is very elegant. It's got great string handling, excellent support for lambdas
                        and other enumerable trickery and is generally very nice to read and write. Ruby also has an
                        exceptionally good package management system (Gems).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ruby does have one major shortcoming, in my opinion, which is the lack of real private methods
                        (Ruby's <code>private</code> methods are the equivalent of C# <code>protected</code> methods and
                        there are no explicit <code>override</code> or <code>new</code> keywords like you have in c#, so
                        it's far too easy to accidentially break/modify functionality from ancestor classes. The general
                        recommendation of Ruby fans/pros in this regard is don't extend classes that you don't know the
                        inner workings of intimately... which is a bit of a cop out I think (work around rather than
                        fix).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <h2><a href="./python.html"><img src="public/img/python-icon.png"> Python</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Python is also a pleasure to work with. Python comprehensions are, imo, a little harder to read
                        than Ruby blocks and lambdas, but this might just be because I'm mostly a C# programmer and the
                        syntax in C# looks more like it does in Ruby. On the other hand, there are generally fewer ways
                        to do things in Python (one recommended way where Ruby has umpteen different possibilities)...
                        I prefer only having to remember one way to do things as I think it makes it easier for
                        developers to read one another's code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python also appears to be generally more popular than Ruby and there's no substitute for a large
                        user base when you need to reach out and ask for help. Finally, Python is quickly becoming the
                        defacto standard in data analytics applications (especially where engineering and scientific
                        computing are concerned)... all of which makes Python an excellent choice for the back-end.

                    Today then, I'm leaning towards Python... and I've just powered up PyCharm to
