                This is a bit of a personal diary while I'm learning some new languages and, since I'm pretty much
                a C# programmer (albeit from a Delphi and Java background many years ago) I'm explaining things
                to myself mostly by way of comparison to C#.
            </p>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h2><a href="./ruby.html"><img src="public/img/ruby-icon.png">Ruby</a></h2>
                <p>
                    On the one hand, Ruby is very elegant. It's got great string handling, excellent support for lambdas
                    and other enumerable trickery and is generally very nice to read and write. Ruby also has an
                    exceptionally good package management system (Gems).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ruby does have one major shortcoming, in my opinion, which is the lack of real private methods
                    (Ruby's <code>private</code> methods are the equivalent of C# <code>protected</code> methods and
                    there are no explicit <code>override</code> or <code>new</code> keywords like you have in c#, so
                    it's far too easy to accidentially break/modify functionality from ancestor classes. The general
                    recommendation of Ruby fans/pros in this regard is don't extend classes that you don't know the
                    inner workings of intimately... which is a bit of a cop out I think (work around rather than
                    fix).

                <p>
                    Python is also a pleasure to work with. It's got cool stuff for creating generators, handling
                    sets and lists and there are generally fewer ways to do things in Python (one recommended way
                    where Ruby has umpteen different possibilities)... which makes it simpler to learn and probably
                    easier for teams top collaborate on code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python also appears to be generally more popular than Ruby, which makes for a large
                    user base when you need to reach out and ask for help. Finally, Python is quickly becoming the
                    de facto standard in data analytics applications (especially where engineering and scientific
                    computing are concerned)... all of which makes Python an excellent choice for the back-end.

                <p>
                    I'm just coming up to speed on Scala now, but my initial impression is <strong>Wow</strong> - I
                    think this might really be the best thing since sliced bread!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scala is definitely not for beginners. It has subtle and complex rules concerning inheritance and
                    many other aspects of it's syntax and behavior... however it is without a doubt extremely powerful!
                    It combines static type checking with the terseness of many scripting languages; OOP with functional
                    programming; compiles to JVM byte code and can use other Java libraries and frameworks, so it comes
                    with batteries included!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the pure pleasure of programming, Scala is awesome. I do wonder how manageable Scala code is for
                    teams. It's easy to write very cryptic code in Scala so I guess good conventions would be important
                    in a successful Scala shop.
